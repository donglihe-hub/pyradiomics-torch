# pyradiomics-torch

New features compared to the pyradiomics library:

1. GPU-accerlerated computation using PyTorch
2. Online computation of radiomics features during training/inference

PS:
I'm not familiar with C so I rewrote the C codes in Python :(

# Limited Support
Only basic functionalities are supported, i.e., default parameters.
